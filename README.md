# Time Series Forecasting for adventureworks Canadian Product Sales

## Overview

This Notebook is the first of a series  where I explore various methods for forecasting time series data.  The provided Jupyter notebook (`Sarima_All_Canadian_Products.ipynb`) uses the SARIMA model to forecast the adventure work dataset sales quantity across all categories and all products on the Canadian market.

## Current Features

- **SARIMA Model Implementation**: The notebook includes a fully implemented Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to predict sales data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations that highlight trends and patterns in the sales data, aiding in the interpretation of the forecasting results.

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Diversification**: Future notebooks will explore additional time series forecasting methods
- **Segmented Analysis**: Plans to forecast sales data separately for different product categories to identify unique trends and variances between groups.
- **Performance Improvements**: Upcoming iterations will focus on refining the forecasting methods to enhance prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
